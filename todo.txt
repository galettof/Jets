Nick:

* add tests for jets of quotients, graph, varieties
* add test for jetProjections (maybe with quotients?)

Fred:

* review code
* do we need to keep the options DegreeMap and DegreeLift?
* line 203 removed reverse
* line 215 list of generators
* it seems ambientPoly is never used, can we remove it?

Also did:

* used describe for jets of quotient
* used matrix for jets of ring map
* added example when coefficient ring is not a field
* tweaked the jets of graphs page a bit
* tweaked docs for jet and projet
* tweaked doc for jetsProjection
* added principal component method
* added Saturate option for principal components
* cited Vojta in Projective doc page and added caveats about heft vectors
