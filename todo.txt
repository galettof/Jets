Fred:

3) cite Vojta's notes in jets(ZZ,PolynomialRing) to show Projective=>true
4) is the cache for jet ideals documented in a separate page? if so, we can remove it from jets(ZZ,Ideal)
5) cite Vojta's notes in jets(ZZ,Ideal) to show Projective=>true
6) add caveat for quotient rings that GBs are computed
7) add example of jets applied to map between quotients
8) cite jets of graph paper in jets(ZZ,Graph)
