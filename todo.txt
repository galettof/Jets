Fred:

4) is the cache for jet ideals documented in a separate page? if so, we can remove it from jets(ZZ,Ideal)
   show cache for jets of rings, ideals, maps
8) cite jets of graph paper in jets(ZZ,Graph)

Also did:

* used describe for jets of quotient
* used matrix for jets of ring map
* added example when coefficient ring is not a field
