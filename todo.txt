Fred:

4) is the cache for jet ideals documented in a separate page? if so, we can remove it from jets(ZZ,Ideal)
   show cache for jets of rings, ideals, maps

Also did:

* used describe for jets of quotient
* used matrix for jets of ring map
* added example when coefficient ring is not a field
* tweaked the jets of graphs page a bit
* tweaked docs for jet and projet
* tweaked doc for jetsProjection
